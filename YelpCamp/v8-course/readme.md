# YelpCamp V8-Course Change Log

* Removed User's comments array from the model's Schema.
* Refactored User-Comment data association.

---

* These updates is supposed to be in v9 according to the course but I accidentally added it in this version instead. With all that, later YelpCamp v9 will be omitted and will jump straight to v10 for the next update.  
  * Added User-Campground data association.
  * Added User authentication for creating new Campground.
